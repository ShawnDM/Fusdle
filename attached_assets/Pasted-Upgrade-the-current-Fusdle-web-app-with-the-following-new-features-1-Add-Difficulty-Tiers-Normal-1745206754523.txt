Upgrade the current Fusdle web app with the following new features:

1. Add Difficulty Tiers (Normal and Hard Mode)

Introduce two puzzles per day:

Normal Puzzle: 2–3 emojis

Hard Puzzle: 4–5 emojis

Default landing page should show the Normal Puzzle first.

After the Normal Puzzle is attempted (solved or skipped), unlock access to the Hard Puzzle for that day.

Add two buttons or tabs to toggle between [Normal Puzzle 🔥] and [Hard Puzzle 💀].

Firebase Firestore should store Normal and Hard puzzles separately, or use a "difficulty" field inside each puzzle document.

Example puzzle document structure:

{ "date": "2025-04-23", "difficulty": "normal", "emojis": ["🐍", "📚"], "answer": "bookworm", "hints": [ "It describes someone who loves reading.", "The second emoji literally hints at it.", "First letter is 'B'." ], "isFusionTwist": false, "twistType": "" }

2. Add Combo/Streak Multipliers

Continue tracking user's streak using localStorage.

Add a flawlessStreak counter that tracks days solved without using any hints.

If a player has a 3+ day streak without using hints, show a "🔥 Streak Mode" badge.

If a player has a 7+ day streak without hints, show a "🔥🔥🔥 Mega Streak" badge.

Update the share result text to reflect the streak, like:

"🔥 4-Day Streak! No hints used!"

Keys in localStorage:

fusdle_streakCount

fusdle_flawlessStreak

3. Add Fusion Twists (Special Puzzle Variants)

Once a week (e.g., Saturdays), introduce a "Fusion Twist."

Twist types can include:

Pun Day

Movie Mash

Fake Fusion (invented/meme words)

Firebase puzzle documents should have fields:

isFusionTwist (true/false)

twistType (string)

When a Fusion Twist is active, display a badge on the homepage like:

"🌀 Fusion Twist Active Today!"

Frontend logic should adjust messaging slightly if a twist is active (e.g., "Today's puzzle has a twist!").

4. Hint Penalty for Share Results

Track if the user requested a hint during the puzzle session.

If a hint was used, degrade the emoji squares in the share result:

Perfect solve: 🟩🟩🟩

1 hint used: ⬜🟩⬜

2 hints used: ⬜⬜🟩

All hints used: ⬜⬜⬜

Update the share text dynamically based on hint usage.

Encourage players to solve without hints to maintain a perfect share grid.

Additional Notes:

Normal and Hard puzzles should be separately tracked in Firebase Firestore under different documents or collections.

Both Normal and Hard puzzles should have independent hints and answer checking.

Streak bonuses should apply whether the player plays only Normal, only Hard, or both — but Hard solves grant 2x bonus streak points if solved without hints.

Home screen should show:

Daily Streak Badge

"Normal Puzzle 🔥" button (always available)

"Hard Puzzle 💀" button (locked until Normal is attempted)

Active Fusion Twist Badge if relevant
